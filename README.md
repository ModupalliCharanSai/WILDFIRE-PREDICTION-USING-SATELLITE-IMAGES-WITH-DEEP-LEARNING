# WILDFIRE-PREDICTION-USING-SATELLITE-IMAGES-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING
Wildfires are a major risk to people, property, and the environment. In recent years, the number and intensity of wildfires have risen, making it essential to create reliable methods of prediction. Remote sensing technologies, including satellite imagery, are being used to forecast wildfire events. These technologies can provide high-resolution images of the earth's surface, which can be used to pinpoint potential wildfire hotspots. Dry leaves and trees can be detected using imagery and other attributes such as humidity and wind speed can be used to support predictions. Image augmentation can be used to create more images for training the model.
